# Lego-Mindstorm-ev3-Pick-and-place-Design
This is the repo for the design of Lego pick and place Mindstorm Ev3. The Design has been created with the help of different parts collected from different sources. We then manipulated and assembled these parts in fusion 360 in order to generate the full assembly of the robot. The below are the snapshots taken from the usdz file.

## Files:

The repo contains an archive of .STEP and .usdz files. Other formats of the Design require very high memory, hence has been excluded. It can be shared if asked upon (OR JUST CONVERT IT with .step!!!!! :)
